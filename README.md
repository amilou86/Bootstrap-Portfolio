                <div class="cardtext">
                    <p>Based in Warrington, Cheshire, I am currently a web developer student. Upon graduating from the
                        bootcamp I hope to have experinece in many coding languages, such as HMTL, CSS, JavaScript, as well as
                        React, Node and API's.
                        I am enthusiastic about staying up to date with the latest web development trends and
                        technologies.</p>
                    <P>What sets me
                        apart is my unique blend of analytical skills and creativity, honed through my work experience
                        in
                        investigations, particularly in handling complex complaints. This has instilled in me a keen
                        attention to
                        detail, problem-solving abilities, and a knack for efficient project managementâ€”traits that I
                        believe are
                        transferable and invaluable in web development.</P>

                    <p>Beyond my technical skills, I bring a creative touch to my work, evident in my hobby as a nail
                        technician and
                        my
                        passion for various creative pursuits. This creativity extends to my approach to web
                        development, where I
                        strive
                        to deliver not only functional but also visually appealing and user-friendly solutions.</p>

                    <p>My dedication to staying informed on current cultural issues and equal rights reflects my
                        commitment
                        to creating inclusive and accessible digital experiences.
